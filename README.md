This project implements a real-time car and pedestrian detection system using the Haar cascade algorithm in Python with OpenCV. The system utilizes pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers for car and pedestrian detection, allowing for accurate identification and localization of objects in images and video streams. The implementation includes features such as drawing rectangles around detected objects and adding labels for easy visualization. This project demonstrates the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques for object detection tasks, with potential use cases in traffic monitoring, surveillance, and autonomous systems.
